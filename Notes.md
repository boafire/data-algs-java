## First class - 1.9.13 ##

### Definitions

**Data structure** - organization of data and its storage allocations in a computer (e.g. list)

**Algorithm** - process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations (e.g. sort)

*Example*: Sort a list of names, size on order of 10^4. Humans are naturally good at `insertion sort`. 

### Course goals ###

Things you'll know by the end of the course:
- Lists
- Trees
- Sets
- Tables/maps
- Graphs
- Recursion
- Evaluation of programming techniques
- Analysis of algorithms

Understanding these topics will help you to make smart trade-offs between expensive resources. The *speed* of a code is the inverse of its cost in computer time. The *length* of a program (lines) relates to its cost in developer time. 

### Course details ###

**Exam Dates**:
1. February 13 in class
1. March 27 in class
1. May 3, 7pm (Final)

**Grading Rubric**
- Programming assignments - 40% (approx 10 hrs each)
- APTs - 10%
- Classwork/recitation - 15%
- Midterms - 10% each
- Final - 15%
Grading errors MUST be reported to gradTA and faculty within 3 business days of reported grade. 

**Late policy**: 24 hrs = 10%. >24 hrs = 50%. >2 weeks = 100%. Start early! 

**Honor Code**: Make sure you understand all the code you write. Write it yourself. Acknowledge any help you receive in the Readme--including instructors, TAs, friends in course--anyone or anything you consult for help on the assignment. (Not necessary for APTs or in-class assignments.) Do not share code. 

### Getting started with Java ###
Java is:
- statically typed (e.g. `int i`, `String s`)
- object oriented (everything will be in a class)
- very verbose

Style tips:
- class names start with a Capital Letter
- `main` tells the computer where to start running the program
- function names start with lowercase_letters


**[ASSIGNMENT DUE FRIDAY](http://www.cs.duke.edu/courses/spring13/compsci201/Recitations/recitation1.html)**: set up Eclipse, write a basic program
